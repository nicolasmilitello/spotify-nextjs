# SPOTIFY APP

## Final Project

This project consists of an application which consumes the Spotify API.

## Technologies

This project was built using NextJs, TypeScript, Tailwind, Jest and Testing Library. This project uses some external libraries like 'spotify-web-api-node', 'react-toastify', among others.

## Description

This application is capable of rendering details about artists, albums, and tracks. It also includes features such as pagination, navigation, and a search bar to look for specific resources.
You can save tracks and albums in your library, and if you have a premium account, you can listen to tracks. Otherwise, in some cases, you will be able to listen to a preview of a song.

## How to try it locally

The first step is to clone the project and install dependencies with `npm install`. <br />
<br />
Then you have to create an app in Spotify for Developers and follow its instructions to set it up.<br /> 
<br />
Finally create an `env.local` file and add the following enviroments variables: <br />
<br />
`NEXTAUTH_URL`<br />
<br />
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_SECRET`<br />
<br />
`NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID`<br />
<br />
`JWT_SECRET`<br />

Now you are ready to execute the command `npm run dev` and to see the project in the localhost.
